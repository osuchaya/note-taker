## Description

This application is part of module 11 on Express.js where the objective is to create a note taker application that allows user to write and save notes. The application uses Express.js to retrieve and save data from JSON file on the back-end and the application codebase is deployed on Heroku cloud platform.

## Learning points
The author learned to implement what is learnt during Express.js module in order to utilize it as a framework to build back-end RESTful APIs with Node.js. Different components were implemented such as Middleware and utility methods such as GET, POST and DELETE to help handle requests and responses. Together Node.js and Express.js allows for more robust application features. The author has deepened her understanding of how to start json.package file and steps to run the script for the server file. The author has also learned to deploy the application on Heroku, rather than Github which is mainly for static pages. 

## Credits
Resources were consulted to complete this application. This includes documents from https://npmjs.com, https://expressjs.com/ and https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli and tutor who helped to explain the concepts clearer and enhance my understanding of the module from which this project is based upon.
